    <h1>Tabletop Role-Playing Games</h1>
    <p>Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs) are games that generally are played with some arrangement of dice, 
        writing implements, and paper. Usually, players control some form of character, which is constructed 
        within the bounds of the rules of the game, as well as the rules set by the person running the game 
        (often referred to as the "<strong>Game Master</strong>", or something similar). While the Game Master 
        creates and controls the world the players are in, the players control their characters, usually rolling 
        dice and adding relevant ability values to the rolls to determine success or failure of their actions. 
        The Game Master rolls in place of enemies and other "<strong>Non-Player Characters</strong>" (NPCs) to 
        determine the results of their actions. The game is primarily played with the story being told by the Game 
        Master, with players choosing their actions, and all imagining the events as they are described. The games 
        can also be used in conjunction with maps and small figures to represent players and NPCs, which are often 
        referred to as tokens, in order for players to better understand the physical landscape descruibed. These 
        types of games are one of my favorite passtimes, and help build creativity, problem-solving skills, 
        as well as learning to view situations from a different perspective than your own.
